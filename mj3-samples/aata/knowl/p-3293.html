<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">However, there are instances where rings behave naturally as vector spaces and we can exploit this extra structure. We will see much more of this in the chapters on fields and Galois theory. As an example, finite fields have a single generator, and the first few powers of the generator form a basis. Consider creating a vector space from the elements of a finite field of order \(7^6=117\,649\text{.}\) As elements of a field we know they can be added, so we will <em class="emphasis">define</em> this to be the addition in our vector space. For any element of the integers mod 7, we can multiply an element of the field by the integer, so we <em class="emphasis">define</em> this to be our scalar multiplication. Later, we will be certain that these two definitions lead to a vector space, but take that for granted now. So here are some operations in our new vector space.</p>
