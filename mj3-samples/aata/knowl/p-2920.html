<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Karl Friedrich Gauss,  born in Brunswick, Germany on April 30, 1777, is considered to be one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived. Gauss was truly a child prodigy. At the age of three he was able to detect errors in the books of his father's business. Gauss entered college at the age of 15. Before the age of 20, Gauss was able to construct a regular \(17\)-sided polygon with a ruler and compass. This was the first new construction of a regular \(n\)-sided polygon since the time of the ancient Greeks. Gauss succeeded in showing that if \(N= 2^{2^n} + 1\) was prime, then it was possible to construct a regular \(N\)-sided polygon.</p>
