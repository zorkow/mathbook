<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Every field is also an integral domain; however, there are many integral domains that are not fields. For example, the integers \({\mathbb Z}\) form an integral domain but not a field. A question that naturally arises is how we might associate an integral domain with a field. There is a natural way to construct the rationals \({\mathbb Q}\) from the integers: the rationals can be represented as formal quotients of two integers. The rational numbers are certainly a field. In fact, it can be shown that the rationals are the smallest field that contains the integers. Given an integral domain \(D\text{,}\) our question now becomes how to construct a smallest field \(F\) containing \(D\text{.}\) We will do this in the same way as we constructed the rationals from the integers.</p>
