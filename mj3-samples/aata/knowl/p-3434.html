<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Algebraic number theory uses the tools of algebra to solve problems in number theory. Modern algebraic number theory began with Pierre de Fermat  (1601â€“1665). Certainly we can find many positive integers that satisfy the equation \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\text{;}\) Fermat conjectured that the equation \(x^n + y^n = z^n\) has no positive integer solutions for \(n \geq 3\text{.}\) He stated in the margin of his copy of the Latin translation of Diophantus' <span class="booktitle">Arithmetica</span> that he had found a marvelous proof of this theorem, but that the margin of the book was too narrow to contain it. Building on work of other mathematicians, it was Andrew Wiles who finally succeeded in proving Fermat's Last Theorem in the 1990s. Wiles's achievement was reported on the front page of the <span class="booktitle">New York Times</span>.</p>
