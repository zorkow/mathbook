<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">A <dfn class="terminology">switch</dfn> is a device, located at some point in an electrical circuit, that controls the flow of current through the circuit. Each switch has two possible states: it can be <dfn class="terminology">open</dfn>,  and not allow the passage of current through the circuit, or a it can be <dfn class="terminology">closed</dfn>,  and allow the passage of current. These states are mutually exclusive. We require that every switch be in one state or the otherâ€”a switch cannot be open and closed at the same time. Also, if one switch is always in the same state as another, we will denote both by the same letter; that is, two switches that are both labeled with the same letter \(a\) will always be open at the same time and closed at the same time.</p>
