<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Noether went to Göttingen to study in 1916. David Hilbert  and Felix Klein  tried unsuccessfully to secure her an appointment at Göttingen. Some of the faculty objected to women lecturers, saying, “What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and are expected to learn at the feet of a woman?” Hilbert, annoyed at the question, responded, “Meine Herren, I do not see that the sex of a candidate is an argument against her admission as a Privatdozent. After all, the Senate is not a bathhouse.” At the end of World War I, attitudes changed and conditions greatly improved for women. After Noether passed her habilitation examination in 1919, she was given a title and was paid a small sum for her lectures.</p>
