<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Most computers have a single central processing unit (CPU) containing one processor chip and can only add two numbers at a time. To add a list of ten numbers, the CPU must do nine additions in sequence. However, a parallel processing computer has more than one CPU. A computer with 10 CPUs, for example, can perform 10 different additions at the same time. If we can take a large integer and break it down into parts, sending each part to a different CPU, then by performing several additions or multiplications simultaneously on those parts, we can work with an integer that the computer would not be able to handle as a whole.</p>
