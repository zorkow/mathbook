<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Although Fior was not the equal of his teacher, he immediately issued a challenge to Niccolo Fontana (1499â€“1557). Fontana was known as Tartaglia  (the Stammerer). As a youth he had suffered a blow from the sword of a French soldier during an attack on his village. He survived the savage wound, but his speech was permanently impaired. Tartaglia sent Fior a list of 30 various mathematical problems; Fior countered by sending Tartaglia a list of 30 depressed cubics. Tartaglia would either solve all 30 of the problems or absolutely fail. After much effort Tartaglia finally succeeded in solving the depressed cubic and defeated Fior, who faded into obscurity.</p>
