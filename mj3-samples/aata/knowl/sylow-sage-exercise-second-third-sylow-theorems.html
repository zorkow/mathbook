<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The proofs of the Second and Third Sylow Theorems (<a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-second-sylow.html" title="Theorem 15.7: Second Sylow Theorem">Theorem 15.7</a>, <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/theorem-third-sylow.html" title="Theorem 15.8: Third Sylow Theorem">Theorem 15.8</a>) employ a group action on sets of Sylow \(p\)-subgroups, For the Second Theorem, the list is proposed as incomplete and is proved to be <em class="emphasis">all</em> of the Sylow \(p\)-subgroups. In this exercise we will see how these actions behave, and how they are different when we use different groups acting on the same set.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Construct the six Sylow \(5\)-subgroups of the alternating group \(A_5\text{.}\) This will be the set of objects for both of our actions. Conjugating one of these Sylow \(5\)-subgroups by an element of \(A_5\) will produce another Sylow \(5\)-subgroup, and so can be used to create a group action. For such an action, from each group element form a Sage permutation of the subgroups by numbering the six subgroups and using these integers as markers for the subgroups. You will find the Python list method <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.index()</code> very helpful. Now use all of these permutations to generate a permutation group (a subgroup of \(S_6\)). Finally, use permutation group methods for orbits and stabilisers, etc. to explore the actions.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">For the first action, use all of \(A_5\) as the group. Show that the resulting action is transitive. In other words, there is exactly one single orbit.</p>
<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">For the second action, use just one of the Sylow \(5\)-subgroups as the group. Write the class equation for this action in a format that suggests the “congruent to \(1\) mod \(p\)” part of the conclusion of the Third Theorem.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sylow-sage-exercises.html#SPp">in-context</a></span>
