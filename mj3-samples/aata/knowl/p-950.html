<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The easiest way to work with permutation group elements in Sage is to write them in cycle notation. Since these are products of disjoint cycles (which commute), we do not need to concern ourselves with the actual order of the cycles. If we write <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">(1,3)(2,4)</code> we probably understand it to be a permutation (the topic of this chapter!) and we know that it could be an element of \(S_4\text{,}\) or perhaps a symmetric group on more symbols than just 4. Sage cannot get started that easily and needs a bit of context, so we coerce a string of characters written with cycle notation into a symmetric group to make group elements. Here are some examples and some sample computations. Remember that Sage and your text differ on how to interpret the order of composing two permutations in a product.</p>
