<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">If traditional cryptosystems are used, anyone who knows enough to encode a message will also know enough to decode an intercepted message. In 1976, W. Diffie  and M. Hellman  proposed public key cryptography, which is based on the observation that the encryption and decryption procedures need not have the same key. This removes the requirement that the encoding key be kept secret. The encoding function \(f\) must be relatively easy to compute, but \(f^{-1}\) must be extremely difficult to compute without some additional information, so that someone who knows only the encrypting key cannot find the decrypting key without prohibitive computation. It is interesting to note that to date, no system has been proposed that has been proven to be “one-way;” that is, for any existing public key cryptosystem, it has never been shown to be computationally prohibitive to decode messages with only knowledge of the encoding key.</p>
