<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">This is useful, but also a bit unsettling. We have the quotient group, but any notion of cosets has been lost, since <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Q</code> is returned as a new permutation group on a different set of symbols. We cannot presume that the numbers used for the new permutation group <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Q</code> bear any resemblance to the cosets we get from the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.cosets()</code> method. But we can see that the quotient group is described as a group generated by two elements of order two. We could ask for the order of the group, or by Lagrange's Theorem we know the quotient has order \(4\text{.}\) We can say now that there are only two groups of order four, the cyclic group of order \(4\) and a non-cyclic group of order \(4\text{,}\) known to us as the Klein \(4\)-group or \({\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2\text{.}\) This quotient group looks like the non-cyclic one since the cyclic group of order 4 has just one element of order 2. Let us see what Sage says.</p>
