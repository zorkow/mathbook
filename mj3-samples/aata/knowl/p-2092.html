<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">For \(n=12\) there are \(2\) abelian groups, and \(3\) non-abelian groups. We know two of the non-abelian groups as a dihedral group, and the alternating group on \(4\) symbols (which is also the symmetries of a tetrahedron). The third non-abelian group is an example of a “dicyclic” group, which is an infinite family of groups, each with order divisible by \(4\text{.}\) The order \(12\) dicyclic group can also be constructed as a “semi-direct product” of two cyclic groups — this is a construction worth knowing as you pursue further study of group theory. The order \(8\) dicyclic group is also the quaternions and more generally, the dicyclic groups of order \(2^k\text{,}\) \(k&gt;2\) are known as “generalized quaternion groups.”</p>
