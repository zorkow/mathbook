<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">The following exercises are less about cosets and subgroups, and more about using Sage as an experimental tool. They are designed to help you become both more efficient, and more expressive, as you write commands in Sage. We will have many opportunities to work with cosets and subgroups in the coming chapters. These exercises do not contain much guidance, and get more challenging as they go. They are designed to explore, or confirm, results presented in this chapter or earlier chapters.</p>
