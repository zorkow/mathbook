<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Ten subfields are described, which is what we would expect, given the 10 subgroups of the Galois group. Each begins with a new number field that is a subfield. Technically, each is not a subset of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">L</code>, but the second item returned for each subfield is an injective homomorphism, also known generally as an “embedding.” Each embedding describes how a primitive element of the subfield translates to an element of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">L</code>. Some of these primitive elements could be manipulated (as we have done above) to yield slightly simpler minimal polynomials, but the results are quite impressive nonetheless. Each item in the list has a third component, which is almost always <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">None</code>, except when the subfield is the whole field, and then the third component is an injective homomorphism “in the other direction.”</p>
