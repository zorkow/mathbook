<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">We can create subgroups by giving the main group a list of “generators.” These elements serve to “generate” a subgroup — imagine multiplying these elements (and their inverses) together over and over, creating new elements that must also be in the subgroup and also become involved in new products, until you see no new elements. Now that definition ends with a horribly imprecise statement, but it should suffice for now. A better definition is that the subgroup generated by the elements is the smallest subgroup of the main group that contains all the generators — which is fine if you know what all the subgroups might be.</p>
