<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Modern coding theory began in 1948 with C. Shannon's  paper, “A Mathematical Theory of Information” [7]. This paper offered an example of an algebraic code, and Shannon's Theorem proclaimed exactly how good codes could be expected to be. Richard Hamming  began working with linear codes at Bell Labs in the late 1940s and early 1950s after becoming frustrated because the programs that he was running could not recover from simple errors generated by noise. Coding theory has grown tremendously in the past several decades. <em class="emphasis">The Theory of Error-Correcting Codes</em>, by MacWilliams and Sloane [5], published in 1977, already contained over 1500 references. Linear codes (Reed-Muller \((32, 6)\)-block codes) were used on NASA's Mariner space probes. More recent space probes such as Voyager have used what are called convolution codes. Currently, very active research is being done with Goppa codes, which are heavily dependent on algebraic geometry.</p>
